## [Description](#table-of-contents)

An E-commerce web application for a local handcrafted soap business. Built with the MERN stack and utilizing Stripe for payment processing.

Huntress Handcrafted Mission statement:

    I started making my own soap to get away from using so many chemical-laden products on
    my own skin and knew that I could create something covetable at a fair price-point.
    Huntress Handcrafted Soaps are proudly made free of sulfates, parabens, and phthalates,
    meaning you won't have to bathe in lotion after using them.
    Synthetic lathering agents used by commercial soap companies are extremely inexpensive
    and have high cleansing properties, but strip the skin of their natural oils, keeping you in the
    constant cycle of slathering on creams and lotions after each and every shower. Here at Huntress, you won't
    find any of those detergents, but true natural soap made with nourishing ingredients like
    lather-licious milk, skin-loving butters, calming botanicals, and cold-pressed fruit juice!
