Professor Peppermint Soap:

My all-time customer favorite and best seller, the Professor Peppermint bar soap was formulated for a powerful post-training clean-feeling! With coconut milk and kokum butter, this refreshing bar is as conditioning as it is cleansing. My longer-lasting and harder formulation still has the silky smooth feel of a milk soap, with the added benefits of activated charcoal, white kaolin clay, and essential oils of peppermint, tea tree and eucalyptus.

Activated charcoal is made by heating hardwood or coconut husk to very high temperatures. It makes the charcoal extremely absorbent, enabling it to bind to and remove toxins.
Activated charcoal is used as an emergency treatment for overdoses and poisonings, as well as in water filters.

IMPORTANT: This bar soap is not recommended for sensitive skin.

Ingredients: Coconut Oil, *Tallow, Water, Coconut Milk, *Sustainable Palm Oil, Lye, Castor Oil, Olive Oil, Kokum Butter, Essential Oil Blend, Sodium Lactate, White Kaolin Clay, Sea Salt, Activated Charcoal, Cane Sugar, Tussah Silk.

Notes about ingredients

My favorite ingredients that go into nearly every batch I make are:

White Kaolin Clay: Clays add color, act as wonderful cleansers, and are used for detoxification. Kaolin clay helps the skin retain moisture and gives bar soap a silky lather. White Kaolin Clay is gentle and great for sensitive skin.

Coconut Milk: Milk soap is creamier and more luscious than soap made with water. The lather is denser, the foam finer and silkier. Milk soaps have the same cleansing power, but milk’s natural oils and acids increase the skin-loving moisture ratio and aid in skin renewal. Half of the fatty acids in coconut milk are lauric acid, which many believe to be antimicrobial.

Coconut Oil: Coconut oil creates a hard, bubbly, and high-cleansing soap bar- I balance the powerful cleansing effect of this oil with skin-loving olive oil.

Castor Oil: This thick, yellow oil is about 90% ricinoleic acid, a fatty acid that is traditionally used to treat skin rashes and infections. Castor oil pumps up the lather for a bubblier bar of soap.

Olive Oil: Where it falls short in cleansing power, it makes up for in skin-loving properties- olive oil is high in antioxidants like vitamin E and polyphenols.

Shea Butter: This creamy, soft butter is high in vitamins A and E, as well as nourishing fatty acids and minerals. Shea butter gives a silky feeling to soap bars.


==========================================================================================

Blurbs: I think it might be helpful to have shop filters, also, so that customers can filter by fragrance or scent family (Mens, Fruity, Fresh, Sweet, Floral, Unscented, Spicy, Herbal), amount of grit (Zero, Light, Medium, Heavy), essential oils only, made for sensitive skin....there are probably other filters that could be helpful but I'm blanking on them. Also, what about a meet the maker page for the mission statement and the values I've implemented in my business?
